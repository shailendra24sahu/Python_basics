    "A \"Run\" object represents a contiguous range of text within a paragraph that shares the same formatting properties.

    "\"This is a <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text.\"\n",

    "2. Paragraph Object:\n",

It can contain multiple runs or other text elements. A paragraph may have its own formatting properties, such as alignment, indentation, line spacing, and more.\n",

    "In Word documents, the levels of headings are typically represented using integer values. The specific integer values used to represent different heading levels can vary depending on the styling and formatting preferences of the document or the Word processing software being used. However, a common convention for representing heading levels in Word documents is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heading 1: Level 1 is usually represented by the integer value 1.\n",
    "- Heading 2: Level 2 is usually represented by the integer value 2.\n",
    "- Heading 3: Level 3 is usually represented by the integer value 3.\n",
    "- Heading 4: Level 4 is usually represented by the integer value 4.\n",
    "- Heading 5: Level 5 is usually represented by the integer value 5.\n",
    "- Heading 6: Level 6 is usually represented by the integer value 6.\n",
    "- Heading 7: Level 7 is usually represented by the integer value 7.\n",
    "- Heading 8: Level 8 is usually represented by the integer value 8.\n",
    "- Heading 9: Level 9 is usually represented by the integer value 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "These integer values are commonly used when programmatically working with Word documents using libraries like `python-docx` or when specifying heading styles using XML or HTML formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the exact mapping of integer values to heading levels may differ based on the specific Word template or document style being used. It's always recommended to refer to the documentation or specific requirements of the Word document we are working with to determine the correct integer values for the desired heading levels."

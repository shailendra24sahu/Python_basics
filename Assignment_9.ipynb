    "1. `os.getcwd()`: This function returns the current working directory (CWD) as a string. The current working directory is the directory from which the Python script is being executed.

Once `os.chdir()` is called, all subsequent file operations (e.g., opening, reading, writing) will be relative to the new working directory.\n",
